- ✅ **produces-markdown-table**: Output contains a markdown table
- ✅ **express-split-by-uk-free-tier**: Express shipping is split into at least two cases distinguishing the UK free tier (UK, order £50+, free) from the paid tier. The split is driven by the UK-only free threshold rule.
- ✅ **express-uses-value-sets**: Express rows use value sets to consolidate cases with the same outcome — e.g. non-UK destinations at/above threshold in one row (such as {Ireland, Other} or {Ireland, International}), or UK at/above threshold in one row ({£50, £75}). Not enumerated as separate rows per destination or per order value when the result is identical. Any reasonable label for non-UK/Ireland destinations is acceptable (International, Other, Rest of World, etc.).
- ❌ **overnight-grouped**: Overnight UK and Ireland are in one row using a value set ({UK, Ireland}) — not separate rows, since both have the same cost and availability.
  > Separate rows 'UK destination | UK | ...' and 'Ireland destination | Ireland | ...' instead of {UK, Ireland}
- ✅ **standard-destination-value-set-or-blank**: Standard shipping destination uses a value set covering all options (e.g. {UK, Ireland, International} or {UK, Ireland, Other}) or is blank/absent — either approach is valid since destination is irrelevant to the cost. Any reasonable label for non-UK/Ireland destinations is acceptable.
- ✅ **output-column-has-question-mark**: At least one output column ends with '?'
- ✅ **concrete-domain-values**: Cell values use concrete domain terms (e.g. 'Standard', 'Express', 'UK', '£3.99') — not abstract codes or raw booleans like 'true', 'false', 'TYPE_1', '1'.
- ✅ **blank-vs-value-set-correct**: Value sets (not blanks) are used for irrelevant inputs — e.g. Standard shipping destination uses a value set like {UK, Ireland, International} because destination exists but doesn't affect the cost. Blanks are reserved for genuinely absent/N/A inputs. The distinction between 'irrelevant to this rule' (value set) and 'not applicable' (blank) is correct.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules. Acceptable to use a single table only when the domain genuinely has a single concern.
- ❌ **no-duplicate-rows-within-a-table**: Judge each table in isolation. The assertion FAILS if a row re-covers an obligation an earlier row in the SAME table already discharged (e.g. a full region x speed x weight cross-product where one row per rate band would state the same rule). Judge each table against its concern's coverage obligations — the distinct behaviours the rule must demonstrate. Where the expected output states those obligations for a concern, judge against that list and do not invent a stricter one; where it does not, derive them from the concern itself. A row that discharges an obligation no other row reaches earns its place however simple it looks, and a value set that covers several values in one row is the preferred discharge, never a failure. Rows that walk one input up while everything else is held are excess when the third and later ones only re-show a direction the first two already established — 'standard applicant, no claims' at ages 30, 40 and 50, or a linear premium sampled at 0, 2 and 4 claims: two samples state the effect and the rest exercise the same arithmetic. They are NOT excess when each value is a boundary, a band, or a distinct branch of the rule — 40 against 41 hours, below/at/above a threshold, one row per rate band — because each then discharges an obligation of its own. ROWS YOU THINK ARE MISSING ARE NEVER A FAILURE HERE — this assertion judges excess rows only, and coverage is judged by this eval's own coverage assertions. Judge every table in the response; your evidence must name each table with PASS or FAIL.
  > Table 1 PASS (orthogonal dims); Table 2 PASS (distinct branches); Table 3 FAIL: UK and Ireland rows both yield 'yes'/'14.99', duplicating an obligation instead of using {UK, Ireland}.
- ❌ **separates-availability-and-cost**: Shipping method availability and shipping cost are in separate tables
  > Table 3 has both 'Available?' and 'Overnight Cost?' columns combined in one table.
- ✅ **blank-output-for-na**: When a shipping method is unavailable (e.g. Overnight outside UK/Ireland), the output clearly indicates non-applicability — either via a blank cost cell in a combined table, or by the availability table showing 'No'/unavailable and the cost table omitting those combinations entirely. Filler text like 'N/A', '-', or '0' is not used for unavailable outcomes.
