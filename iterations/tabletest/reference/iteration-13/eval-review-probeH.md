## Per-Eval Results

### ✅ Eval eval-1-convert-repetitive-tests

**13/13** · 0 tokens · 0ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: Table has at least one column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Discount?' or 'Expected?')
- ✅ **has-three-data-rows**: Table has exactly 3 data rows (GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE)
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'discountByCustomerTier' → 'Discount By Customer Tier'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: PASSES when no @Description is present anywhere in the class — omitting it is always acceptable, and this assertion NEVER penalises its absence. Do not fail it for a missing @Description, and do not treat a @DisplayName as a substitute. When a @Description IS present, it must provide context beyond what the table rows already express — such as fixed values shared by all rows, or where/when the rule applies — and FAILS when it merely restates the column names or summarises what the rows already show.
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (pom.xml) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding
- ✅ **tests-pass**: The generated tests pass when executed against DiscountService
