## Per-Eval Results

### ✅ Eval eval-1-convert-repetitive-tests

**13/13** · 438137 tokens · 48254ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: Table has at least one column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Discount?' or 'Expected?')
- ✅ **has-three-data-rows**: Table has exactly 3 data rows (GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE)
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'discountByCustomerTier' → 'Discount By Customer Tier'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as fixed values shared by all rows, where/when the rule applies, or open questions. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show.
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (pom.xml) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding
- ✅ **tests-pass**: The generated tests pass when executed against DiscountService

### ✅ Eval eval-2-parse-dates

**15/15** · 815800 tokens · 115205ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **null-as-blank-cell**: Null input is represented as a blank cell (not the string 'null') in the table
- ✅ **exception-handled-cleanly**: The empty string / exception case is handled — either via a Throws? column, assertThrows inside the method, or a separate @TableTest — rather than being silently omitted
- ✅ **localdate-result-column**: There is a result column typed as LocalDate (or using a string representation that maps to LocalDate)
- ✅ **type-conversion-addressed**: The response addresses type conversion for non-trivial column types — either by providing a @TypeConverter/converter method, or by using a cell representation that TableTest's built-in conversion handles
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'dateParsing' → 'Date Parsing'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as where/when the rule applies, or open questions
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **empty-string-uses-quotes**: Empty string input uses quoted syntax (e.g. '' or "") in the table — not a blank cell, which represents null. The distinction between empty string and null is preserved.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns
- ✅ **separates-valid-and-invalid**: Valid parsing cases and error/exception cases are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ✅ Eval eval-7-permission-check

**13/13** · 585941 tokens · 59895ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **uses-value-sets**: Table uses value-set syntax (curly braces like {READ, WRITE} or {READ, WRITE, DELETE}) to express rules that hold across multiple actions — rather than one row per role/action combination
- ✅ **fewer-than-nine-rows**: Table has fewer than 9 data rows (i.e. does not enumerate every role/action combination individually)
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **no-duplicate-role-output**: No two rows share both the same Role value and the same boolean output — forces value set consolidation
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'permissionsByRoleAndAction' → 'Permissions By Role And Action'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'canPerform'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Admin performs any action', 'Guest reads') — not outcomes ('Allowed', 'Denied')
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ✅ Eval eval-8-money-parse

**15/15** · 606672 tokens · 87611ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **null-as-blank-cell**: Null input is represented as a blank cell in the valid inputs @TableTest table (not the string 'null', and not as a separate @Test method). The blank cell maps to a null parameter.
- ✅ **exception-has-expected-column**: The exception/invalid-input table has an expected column (e.g. 'Throws?' or 'Exception?') specifying the exception type per row — rather than hardcoding the exception type in @Description or the method name.
- ✅ **exception-cases-handled**: The exception cases (empty string, letters-only, negative) are handled — via a Throws? column, assertThrows in the method body, or a separate @TableTest — not silently omitted
- ✅ **result-column-with-question-mark**: Valid inputs have a result column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Money?' or 'Result?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'moneyParsing' → 'Money Parsing'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as the expected currency format, or open questions. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show. It is acceptable to omit @Description if the table already conveys all relevant context.
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules. Acceptable to use a single table only when the domain genuinely has a single concern.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns. Fewer rows per table is expected when concerns are properly separated.
- ✅ **separates-valid-and-invalid**: Valid parsing cases and error/exception cases are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ✅ Eval eval-9-bonus-contractor-structure

**13/13** · 553264 tokens · 82396ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **contractor-uses-value-set**: CONTRACTOR row uses a value set for Department (e.g. {SALES, ENGINEERING}) to express 'regardless of department' — not a dummy placeholder like 'ANY' or 'N/A', and not enumerated as separate rows.
- ✅ **four-core-rules-covered**: The four level×department combinations (SENIOR+SALES, SENIOR+ENGINEERING, JUNIOR+SALES, JUNIOR+ENGINEERING) are all present in the table(s)
- ✅ **expects-bonus-percentage**: The expected output column contains bonus percentages (e.g. 15%, 12%, 0%) — not bonus amounts. The method returns a percentage, and the table should reflect that.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'bonusByLevelAndDepartment' → 'Bonus By Level And Department'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as how bonus rates are applied (e.g. as percentage of base salary), or open questions. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show. It is acceptable to omit @Description if the table already conveys all relevant context.
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Senior in Sales', 'Contractor regardless of department') — not outcomes ('Gets 15%', 'No bonus').
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Level', 'Department', 'Bonus %') — not implementation terms like 'employeeLevel', 'deptCode', 'result'.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-14-weekly-pay

**19/20** · 1307679 tokens · 264939ms

- ✅ **1.2-error-has-expected-column**: The error/rejection table has an expected column (e.g. 'Throws?' or 'Exception?') specifying the exception type per row — rather than hardcoding the exception type in @Description or the method name.
- ✅ **1.3-depth-overtime-boundary**: Overtime threshold boundary is covered: at least a value at the threshold (40) and just above (41 or similar). Not just values well below and well above.
- ✅ **1.4-depth-combined-scenario**: A combined scenario is present: a row with weekday + Sunday + holiday hours, testing the composition of all hour types.
- ✅ **1.5-depth-error-edge-cases**: Error/edge cases covered: at least negative hours (floored at zero) and negative or missing rate (rejected).
- ❌ **1.6-readability-empty-cells**: Sunday and Holiday hour columns use empty cells (not 0) when those inputs are not relevant to a scenario — making it easier to spot which rows involve weekend/holiday hours. This is a readability preference; parameter types should be Integer (not int) to support null from blank cells.
  > Weekday pay table uses explicit '0' values: '| 0 | 20.00 |' and '| 30 | 20.00 |' rather than empty cells for irrelevant columns
- ✅ **1.7-readability-scenario-names**: Scenario names describe work patterns (e.g. 'Part-time', 'Five hours overtime', 'Full Sunday shift') — not 'Test case 1' or expected outcomes.
- ✅ **1.8-correctness-expected-values**: Expected values in intermediate and total columns are arithmetically correct for every row, consistent with the formulas in @Description.
- ✅ **1.9-correctness-value-set-semantics**: Value sets are only used where all values in the set produce the same expected result (e.g. any rate × 0 = 0). Not used where results would differ.
- ✅ **1.10-format-displayname**: @DisplayName is present on test methods, OR method names read as clear descriptive titles when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **1.11-format-description**: @Description is present on at least the pay calculation method and provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as the overtime threshold (40 hours), premium multipliers (Sunday 2×, Holiday 2.5×), or other fixed assumptions not visible in the table. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show.
- ✅ **1.12-format-annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **1.13-format-description-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **1.14-depth-zero-rate**: A row where the hourly rate is zero, showing that pay is zero regardless of hours worked. This is a distinct edge case from negative rate (which is rejected).
- ✅ **1.15-format-clean-method**: The test method body contains no if/ternary null-handling or parsing logic. Null-to-default conversion is handled via a @TypeConverter method or a private helper, keeping the test method limited to arrange/act/assert.
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Weekday hours', 'Sunday hours', 'Hourly rate', 'Weekly pay?') — not implementation terms like 'weekdayHrs', 'int', 'param1'.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
- ✅ **separates-classification-and-calculation**: Payable hours categorisation (1x regular, 1.5x overtime, 2x Sunday/holiday) and pay calculation (hours × rate) are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-15-reis-discount

**21/23** · 2287509 tokens · 411343ms

- ✅ **2.1-decomposition-concern-separation**: Discount ladder, and traveller eligibility are in separate tables. Rolling window counting as a third table is desirable.
- ✅ **2.2-children-flat-discount**: Children's flat 20% discount is represented — either as a row in the eligibility table or a separate note. It does not follow the ladder.
- ✅ **2.3-depth-tier-boundaries**: The discount ladder has multiple tiers derived from the 'every fifth trip' rule, with boundary values or value sets showing which ticket counts produce which discount. The maximum 40% discount is represented.
- ✅ **2.4-depth-rolling-window-boundary**: The 30-day rolling window boundary is tested: a ticket at exactly 30 days is included, at 31 days is excluded.
- ✅ **2.9-correctness-value-set-tier-semantics**: Value sets in the tier table contain exactly the values that produce the same discount. No cross-tier contamination.
- ✅ **2.15-ticket-count-uses-value-sets**: The discount ladder table uses value sets for the ticket count column to group counts within the same tier (e.g. {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} or {5, 9} for min/max → 5%) — not one row per boundary value. The 'every fifth trip' rule creates tiers; the table should express tiers, not enumerate boundaries.
- ✅ **2.16-no-duplicate-tier-mapping**: The tier-to-discount mapping is expressed once — not repeated across multiple tables. A price application table (if present) should test the arithmetic (base price × discount → final price) without re-enumerating which ticket counts map to which tier.
- ✅ **2.10-format-displayname**: @DisplayName is present on test methods, OR method names read as clear descriptive titles when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **2.11-format-description**: @Description is present on at least the class or the tier method and provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as the discount ladder structure, eligibility rules, or application context. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show.
- ✅ **2.13-format-annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **2.14-format-description-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ❌ **2.17-zone-irrelevance-visible**: The eligibility/passenger-type table includes a Zone column (or equivalent) with a value set to show that the discount applies regardless of zone — rather than silently omitting zone. The requirement explicitly says 'regardless of the zones you travel in'.
  > countSingleTicketsInWindow tests zone-independence with rows like 'Zone does not affect the count | [1/SINGLE/ZONE_1, 2/SINGLE/ZONE_2, 3/SINGLE/ZONE_3] | 3', but discountForCategoryAndTripCount eligibility table lacks explicit Zone column
- ✅ **2.18-adult-senior-value-set**: Adult and senior are expressed as a value set {ADULT, SENIOR} (or equivalent) in at least one row of the eligibility table, since they follow identical discount rules. Not enumerated as separate rows with the same outcome.
- ✅ **2.19-depth-all-tiers**: All 9 discount tiers are represented in the ladder table: 0% (tickets 1-4), 5% (5-9), 10% (10-14), 15% (15-19), 20% (20-24), 25% (25-29), 30% (30-34), 35% (35-39), and 40% (40+). Not just a subset of tiers.
- ✅ **2.20-readability-one-row-per-tier**: Each tier in the discount ladder is expressed as a single row with a value set for ticket counts — not split across multiple rows (e.g. separate rows for 'tier kicks in' and 'tier holds'). One tier = one row.
- ✅ **2.21-readability-relative-time**: The rolling window table expresses time relatively (e.g. '14 days ago', '30 days ago', or an integer 'Days ago' column) rather than using absolute dates, making the table readable without needing to know the reference date.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules. Acceptable to use a single table only when the domain genuinely has a single concern.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns. Fewer rows per table is expected when concerns are properly separated.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable. Judge each @TableTest table independently; the assertion FAILS if any table meets any of these conditions: (1) its expectation column holds the same value in every row; (2) in every row, each expectation cell is a verbatim copy of a cell in an input column of the same row; (3) an implementation that ignored the input columns entirely and returned a fixed value would satisfy every row. Otherwise the assertion PASSES. Do not fail a table merely because its values are simple or round — only these three conditions matter.
- ❌ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body. The assertion FAILS if any of these hold for any @TableTest: (1) a value needed to predict the expectation (a threshold, rate, cutoff, multiplier, reference date) appears only in the method body or a field, and in neither a column, the @DisplayName, nor the @Description; (2) the operation applied to the inputs cannot be named from the column headers and cell values alone; (3) a helper method used in the assertion applies a comparison criterion (ordering, tolerance, subset matching) that is stated nowhere in the table, title, or description. Otherwise the assertion PASSES. Setup that merely constructs the objects named by the columns is not a failure.
  > countSingleTicketsInWindow: the 30-day window boundary and PURCHASE_TIME reference date are stated in @Description but the exact boundary rule ('exactly 30 days ago is still in window') is not in column headers. The operation 'count single tickets' is clear, but the precise 30-day threshold and inclusion rule depend on @Description text, not the table alone.
- ✅ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName (or the method name it falls back to) states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on. Apply the check mechanically: strike the system under test from the sentence — if it still reads as true, because it merely restates a regulation, standard, format, or domain fact, the title is about something else and fails.
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-18-convert-from-code

**20/24** · 826034 tokens · 148196ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ❌ **black-box-columns**: Table columns represent the method's public inputs (applicant type, age, claim count) and observable outputs (decision, premium) — not internal state like hasActivePolicy, internalRiskScore, or calculateRiskScore.
  > @Description states 'Risk score is age/10 + claimCount * 15' and 'rejected once the score exceeds 75' — internal formula exposed in description, not just observable behavior.
- ✅ **observable-io-only**: No column is named after private fields or internal variables (hasActivePolicy, internalRiskScore, riskScore). The test treats the method as a black box.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Applicant type', 'Age', 'Claims', 'Decision?', 'Premium?') — not code identifiers like 'applicantType', 'claimCount', 'String'.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Renewal with no claims', 'Senior applicant') — not outcomes ('Auto approved', 'Rejected').
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: Table has at least one column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Decision?' or 'Premium?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
- ✅ **separates-decision-and-premium**: Decision logic (AUTO_APPROVED/REJECTED/APPROVED) and premium calculation are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **no-reimplemented-internals**: Test method body does not recompute internal formulas. It only calls the public API (evaluateApplication) and asserts on the return value's fields.
- ❌ **description-no-internals**: @Description explains the test's purpose and business context — not internal formulas or implementation details.
  > @Description in rejectsApplicationsAboveRiskThreshold: 'Risk score is age/10 + claimCount * 15...score exceeds 75' — explicitly restates internal formula.
- ❌ **depth-decision-boundaries**: Approval decision table covers the rejection boundary thoroughly: 5 claims triggers rejection regardless of realistic age (risk score crosses 75), 4 claims results in approval. Rows at 4 and 5 claims with varying ages demonstrate this cliff. Senior vs non-senior distinction (64 vs 65) also visible in the decision table.
  > Decision table (rejectsApplicationsAboveRiskThreshold) tests 5 claims at ages 9 and 10, but does NOT test 4 claims. Senior boundary (64 vs 65) is in premium table, not decision table.
- ✅ **depth-premium-boundaries**: Approved premium table covers boundary effects: the premium jump from 0 to 1 claim (impact of +15 risk score on premium), and the premium difference at age 64 vs 65 (standard vs senior formula). These boundary conditions document how premium changes at each threshold.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable. Judge each @TableTest table independently; the assertion FAILS if any table meets any of these conditions: (1) its expectation column holds the same value in every row; (2) in every row, each expectation cell is a verbatim copy of a cell in an input column of the same row; (3) an implementation that ignored the input columns entirely and returned a fixed value would satisfy every row. Otherwise the assertion PASSES. Do not fail a table merely because its values are simple or round — only these three conditions matter.
- ❌ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body. The assertion FAILS if any of these hold for any @TableTest: (1) a value needed to predict the expectation (a threshold, rate, cutoff, multiplier, reference date) appears only in the method body or a field, and in neither a column, the @DisplayName, nor the @Description; (2) the operation applied to the inputs cannot be named from the column headers and cell values alone; (3) a helper method used in the assertion applies a comparison criterion (ordering, tolerance, subset matching) that is stated nowhere in the table, title, or description. Otherwise the assertion PASSES. Setup that merely constructs the objects named by the columns is not a failure.
  > @Description for rejectsApplicationsAboveRiskThreshold states 'Risk score is age/10 + claimCount * 15' and 'exceeds 75', but the table columns are 'Applicant Type | Age | Claim Count | Status? | Premium?' — the formula and threshold 75 appear only in @Description, not in column headers or cell values. Reader cannot derive the rule from table alone.
- ✅ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName (or the method name it falls back to) states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on. Apply the check mechanically: strike the system under test from the sentence — if it still reads as true, because it merely restates a regulation, standard, format, or domain fact, the title is about something else and fails.

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **list-syntax-correct**: List values in the table use bracket syntax like [tech:java, biz:sales, dev:ci] — not comma-separated strings without brackets.
- ✅ **empty-list-explicit**: Empty list input uses [] (not a blank cell, which represents null). The distinction between empty list and null is preserved.
- ✅ **special-chars-quoted**: Values containing pipes (|), brackets, or colons (:) are properly quoted (e.g. "tech:java") so they don't conflict with table syntax.
- ✅ **set-syntax-correct**: Set<String> values in the table use curly brace syntax like {tech, dev} — not bracket syntax [tech, dev] which is for lists.
- ✅ **newline-in-cell**: A cell value containing a newline does not break the table row structure: the newline is either escaped as \n inside the cell, or the value is expressed as a list of lines joined in the test body.
- ✅ **pipe-quoted**: Values containing pipe characters (|) are quoted so they don't conflict with the markdown table column separator.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Filtered tags?' or 'Result?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **no-blank-collection-elements**: No collection value in any table contains a blank element. `[a, , c]`, `[a, b, ]` and `[, a, b]` are parse errors, not collections holding a null element.

- ✅ **validation-rules-covered**: Email validation and name-required error scenarios are present — at least one row for invalid email and one for missing name.
- ✅ **blank-for-absent-optional**: Dietary requirements and/or accessibility needs use blank cells (null) when not provided — not 'N/A' or 'none'.
- ✅ **blank-vs-value-set-correct**: When testing pricing rules, irrelevant inputs use value sets or representative values — not blanks.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Result?', 'Price?')
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Name', 'Email', 'Registration date', 'Group size', 'Price?') — not code identifiers.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Early-bird single attendee', 'Missing name') — not outcomes ('Rejected', '20% off').
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table.
- ❌ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations.
  > Validation table has 11 rows including 4 distinct malformed-email cases ('missing @', 'missing local part', 'missing domain', 'missing TLD') beyond the 2 representative invalids specified
- ✅ **separates-validation-and-pricing**: Input validation and pricing/discount calculation are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **validation-includes-optional-fields**: Validation @TableTest includes Dietary Requirements and Accessibility Needs columns, with rows showing both null and non-null values are accepted.
- ✅ **descriptive-registration-date**: Registration date uses descriptive values (e.g. 'before cutoff', 'on cutoff', 'after cutoff') with a @TypeConverter method converting to actual dates.
- ✅ **cutoff-date-column-if-literal-dates**: If registration dates are literal (e.g. '2025-02-28' instead of descriptive), the early-bird cutoff date appears as a separate policy column so the reader can see both dates and verify the comparison. Passes automatically if descriptive date values are used.
- ❌ **description-no-irrelevant-information**: If @Description is present, it does not include information that is already visible in the table columns or that can be derived from the table structure — such as fixed input values that could be columns, or restating the discount rules that the rows already demonstrate.
  > Validation @Description states 'dietaryRequirements and accessibilityNeeds are optional and do not affect acceptance' — this is already demonstrated by the table rows (columns present, values vary, all accepted).
- ✅ **discount-column-preferred**: Output column is 'Discount?' (percentage or amount off) rather than 'Price?' — making verification simpler (discount is the rule's direct output; price requires knowing the base price). If 'Price?' is used instead, both 'Base price' and 'Price?' columns must be present so the reader can trace the calculation.
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **optional-fields-has-expected-column**: The optional-fields acceptance table includes an expectation/output column (e.g. 'Approved?', 'Result?', or 'Status?') asserting that each combination is accepted — not just varying inputs without any expected column.
- ✅ **description-no-redundant-field-values**: Scenario names and @Description text do not restate values the table already shows. The assertion FAILS if either: (1) a scenario name contains a literal value that also appears in an input cell of the same row (e.g. scenario 'Age 35, score 700' beside Age and Credit score columns holding 35 and 700); or (2) @Description states a fixed value for an input that is already a column in that table. Otherwise it PASSES. Stating a constant that is NOT a column — a threshold, a policy figure, a value fixed in the method body — is correct and must not fail this assertion.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable. Judge each @TableTest table independently; the assertion FAILS if any table meets any of these conditions: (1) its expectation column holds the same value in every row; (2) in every row, each expectation cell is a verbatim copy of a cell in an input column of the same row; (3) an implementation that ignored the input columns entirely and returned a fixed value would satisfy every row.

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **threshold-verifiable-from-table**: Each policy threshold (650 for non-seniors, 600 for seniors) is verifiable from the table, in one of two ways: (a) a dedicated policy column (e.g. 'Credit threshold') beside the applicant's score, or (b) boundary rows that bracket it — within one age band, a row that qualifies just above the threshold and a row that fails at/below it, carrying different decisions.
- ✅ **concrete-domain-values**: Cell values use concrete domain terms (e.g. '70', '650', 'APPROVED') — not abstract codes like 'CATEGORY_A' or '1'. Boolean true/false is acceptable for yes/no flags when the parameter type is boolean.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Senior at lower threshold', 'Missing income') — not outcomes ('Approved', 'Rejected').
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Age', 'Credit score', 'Stable income', 'Decision?') — not code identifiers like 'customerAge', 'boolean'.
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Decision?' or 'Status?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements

- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: The distinct concerns (age→threshold, credit boundary, income status) are each covered, without a monolithic table that re-proves unrelated rules through redundant permutations. A single table is acceptable when the concerns share the same input columns and each is covered by only a row or two.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns. Fewer rows per table is expected when concerns are properly separated.
- ✅ **covers-age-credit-income**: Age boundary policy, credit score categorisation, and income status are each covered by minimal scenarios. This may be one @TableTest whose rows exercise each concern (boundary pairs for age/credit, income held-constant rows for income status) or separate methods per concern with a combining verdict — both are correct given only a row or two per concern.
- ✅ **description-no-redundant-field-values**: Scenario names and @Description text do not restate values the table already shows. The assertion FAILS if either: (1) a scenario name contains a literal value that also appears in an input cell of the same row (e.g. scenario 'Age 35, score 700' beside Age and Credit score columns holding 35 and 700); or (2) @Description states a fixed value for an input that is already a column in that table.
- ✅ **depth-stable-income-effect**: The effect of stable income on the outcome is visible from table rows, not merely implied. The assertion PASSES if some single @TableTest table contains two rows that differ in the stable-income column (or equivalent) while holding the credit score and age columns equal, and those two rows carry different expected decisions.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency

- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Add to empty cart', 'Replace active coupon with expired') — not outcomes ('Error', 'Success').
- ❌ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Product', 'Quantity', 'Message?', 'Cart total?') — not code identifiers like 'productId', 'result'.
  > Column header 'Product Id' uses code identifier 'Id'; should be 'Product'. Also 'Active Coupon' and 'Coupon In Store' are business language, but 'Product Id' violates the rule
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **test-data-visible**: Product prices and coupon rules (type, amount, expiry status) are visible in the table via columns, @Description, or explicit setup — not silently hardcoded. The reader can trace how inputs lead to outputs.
- ✅ **type-converters-for-complex-objects**: TypeConverter methods are used to convert map/string table values into domain objects (e.g. Map → Cart, Map → InventoryService, map → Coupon). Test method bodies contain only arrange-act-assert — no object construction from raw table values.
- ✅ **coupon-as-single-column**: Coupon data is expressed in a single column with a @TypeConverter — not spread across separate sparse columns for coupon type, value, and target product.
- ✅ **uses-standard-map-syntax**: Columns representing maps use standard TableTest map syntax — [k: v, k2: v2] for entries and [:] for empty map — not a custom bracket notation.
- ❌ **description-not-redundant-with-scenarios**: @Description annotations do not repeat information that the scenario names already convey.
  > The `addsItemsFromTheCatalogue` @Description states 'Adding a product already in the cart increases its quantity rather than replacing it', which is already conveyed by the scenario name 'Add more of an item already in the cart'.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable.
- ❌ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body.
  > The `calculatesTheCartTotal` table's last row 'Empty cart, any coupon' uses a set notation '{PERCENT 50, FIXED 5.00}' to indicate multiple coupon types produce the same result, but the semantics of this set notation and how it is parsed are not explained in the table, @DisplayName, or @Description.
- ✅ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on.
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple @TableTest methods are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing all splitting rules.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each @TableTest has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
- ✅ **concern-fulfillment-method**: Fulfillment method splitting is represented as its own @TableTest — items with different fulfillment types (store pickup vs home delivery) cannot share a shipment.
- ✅ **concern-delivery-address**: Delivery address splitting is represented as its own @TableTest — items going to different addresses must be in separate shipments.
- ✅ **concern-availability**: Availability splitting is represented as its own @TableTest — in-stock items ship immediately, backordered/pre-ordered items ship when available.
- ✅ **concern-warehouse-allocation**: Warehouse allocation (minimising shipments) is represented as its own @TableTest — choosing which warehouses to ship from to minimise total shipment count.
- ✅ **concern-companion-products**: Companion product grouping is represented as its own @TableTest — paired items (e.g. camera body and lens) should ship together from the same location when possible.
- ✅ **all-outputs-same-table**: Each @TableTest method includes all output columns for its concern in the same table — e.g. warehouse allocation includes both the assignment and shipment count, not split across methods. All outputs of the same concern belong together.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Shipments?', 'Groups?')
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe the business situation (e.g. 'Consolidate: two beats three', 'Everything at one warehouse') — not 'Test case 2'.
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use business/domain language (e.g. 'Shipments?' not 'Result?', 'Warehouse stock' not 'inventory_map'). The tables read as a specification a product person could review.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
