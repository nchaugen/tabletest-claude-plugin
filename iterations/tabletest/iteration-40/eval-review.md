## Per-Eval Results

### ✅ Eval eval-1-convert-repetitive-tests

**13/13** · 438137 tokens · 48254ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: Table has at least one column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Discount?' or 'Expected?')
- ✅ **has-three-data-rows**: Table has exactly 3 data rows (GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE)
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'discountByCustomerTier' → 'Discount By Customer Tier'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as fixed values shared by all rows, where/when the rule applies, or open questions. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show. It is acceptable to omit @Description if the table already conveys all relevant context (e.g. fixed values are included as a column rather than hardcoded in the method body).
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (pom.xml) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding
- ✅ **tests-pass**: The generated tests pass when executed against DiscountService

### ✅ Eval eval-2-parse-dates

**15/15** · 815800 tokens · 115205ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **null-as-blank-cell**: Null input is represented as a blank cell (not the string 'null') in the table
- ✅ **exception-handled-cleanly**: The empty string / exception case is handled — either via a Throws? column, assertThrows inside the method, or a separate @TableTest — rather than being silently omitted
- ✅ **localdate-result-column**: There is a result column typed as LocalDate (or using a string representation that maps to LocalDate)
- ✅ **type-conversion-addressed**: The response addresses type conversion for non-trivial column types — either by providing a @TypeConverter/converter method, or by using a cell representation that TableTest's built-in conversion handles
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'dateParsing' → 'Date Parsing'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as where/when the rule applies, or open questions
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **empty-string-uses-quotes**: Empty string input uses quoted syntax (e.g. '' or "") in the table — not a blank cell, which represents null. The distinction between empty string and null is preserved.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns
- ✅ **separates-valid-and-invalid**: Valid parsing cases and error/exception cases are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-7-permission-check

**12/13** · 585941 tokens · 59895ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **uses-value-sets**: Table uses value-set syntax (curly braces like {READ, WRITE} or {READ, WRITE, DELETE}) to express rules that hold across multiple actions — rather than one row per role/action combination
- ✅ **fewer-than-nine-rows**: Table has fewer than 9 data rows (i.e. does not enumerate every role/action combination individually)
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ❌ **no-duplicate-role-output**: No two rows share both the same Role value and the same boolean output
  > Row 6 (Guest cannot write | GUEST | WRITE | false) and Row 7 (Guest cannot delete | GUEST | DELETE | false) both have GUEST role and false outcome
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'permissionsByRoleAndAction' → 'Permissions By Role And Action'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'canPerform'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond table rows
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions, not outcomes
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-8-money-parse

**14/15** · 606672 tokens · 87611ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **null-as-blank-cell**: Null input is represented as a blank cell in the valid inputs @TableTest table (not the string 'null', and not as a separate @Test method). The blank cell maps to a null parameter.
- ✅ **exception-has-expected-column**: The exception/invalid-input table has an expected column (e.g. 'Throws?' or 'Exception?') specifying the exception type per row
- ✅ **exception-cases-handled**: The exception cases (empty string, letters-only, negative) are handled — via a Throws? column, assertThrows in the method body, or a separate @TableTest
- ✅ **result-column-with-question-mark**: Valid inputs have a result column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Money?' or 'Result?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'moneyParsing' → 'Money Parsing'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern
- ❌ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations
  > Valid table has only 3 rows (10.00, 0.01, null); missing rows exploring scale/format assumptions (e.g., '5' vs '5.00', '10.5', leading '+', whitespace, zero boundary)
- ✅ **separates-valid-and-invalid**: Valid parsing cases and error/exception cases are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ✅ Eval eval-9-bonus-contractor-structure

**13/13** · 553264 tokens · 82396ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **contractor-uses-value-set**: CONTRACTOR row uses a value set for Department (e.g. {SALES, ENGINEERING}) to express 'regardless of department' — not a dummy placeholder like 'ANY' or 'N/A', and not enumerated as separate rows.
- ✅ **four-core-rules-covered**: The four level×department combinations (SENIOR+SALES, SENIOR+ENGINEERING, JUNIOR+SALES, JUNIOR+ENGINEERING) are all present in the table(s)
- ✅ **expects-bonus-percentage**: The expected output column contains bonus percentages (e.g. 15%, 12%, 0%) — not bonus amounts. The method returns a percentage, and the table should reflect that.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case (e.g. 'bonusByLevelAndDepartment' → 'Bonus By Level And Department'). Not a generic name like 'test1' or 'testMethod'.
- ✅ **description-if-present-adds-information**: If @Description is present, it provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as how bonus rates are applied (e.g. as percentage of base salary), or open questions. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show.
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Senior in Sales', 'Contractor regardless of department') — not outcomes ('Gets 15%', 'No bonus').
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Level', 'Department', 'Bonus %') — not implementation terms like 'employeeLevel', 'deptCode', 'result'.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-14-weekly-pay

**15/20** · 1307679 tokens · 264939ms

- ✅ **1.2-error-has-expected-column**: Negative rate is rejected — a rejection row with an expected-exception column.
- ✅ **1.3-depth-overtime-boundary**: The 40/41 pair shows where overtime starts; both the boundary and just-over cases are explicit rows.
- ✅ **1.4-depth-combined-scenario**: An all-bands row shows the bands compose rather than shadow each other.
- ✅ **1.5-depth-error-edge-cases**: Negative hours edge case is made explicit in a row, showing the chosen semantics.
- ❌ **1.6-readability-empty-cells**: Reference valid rows use blank cells (not 0) for unused bands, and parameters are Integer not int.
  > All hour parameters are declared as 'double', not 'Integer'. Unused bands (e.g., Sunday/Holiday when testing weekday-only) are shown as 0, not blank cells.
- ✅ **1.7-readability-scenario-names**: Scenario names describe work patterns (e.g. 'Part-time', 'Five hours overtime', 'Full Sunday shift') — not 'Test case 1' or expected outcomes
- ✅ **1.8-correctness-expected-values**: Arithmetic is internally consistent with the rule the rows state.
- ❌ **1.9-correctness-value-set-semantics**: Zero rate is tested as a value set over several hour shapes, since they all collapse to zero.
  > Only one row tests zero rate: 'Zero hourly rate is allowed | 40 | 5 | 0 | 0.00 | 0.00'. A value set like {40, 0, 0}, {0, 5, 0}, {0, 0, 8} at rate 0 would better demonstrate the rule.
- ✅ **1.10-format-displayname**: @DisplayName is present on test methods, OR method names read as clear descriptive titles when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ❌ **1.11-format-description**: @Description provides context beyond what the table rows already express and does NOT restate the rate multipliers or overtime threshold
  > @Description states 'Overtime threshold is fixed at 40 hours/week; hours beyond it are paid at 1.5x' and 'Sunday hours and holiday hours are both always paid at double time (2x)' — restating multipliers already shown in rows
- ✅ **1.12-format-annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **1.13-format-description-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **1.14-depth-zero-rate**: Zero rate is allowed and yields zero pay for any hours — made explicit as a row.
- ✅ **1.15-format-clean-method**: The test method body contains no if/ternary null-handling or parsing logic. Null-to-default conversion is handled via a @TypeConverter method or a private helper, keeping the test method limited to arrange/act/assert.
- ❌ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Weekday hours', 'Sunday hours', 'Hourly rate', 'Weekly pay?') — not implementation terms like 'weekdayHrs', 'int', 'param1'.
  > Columns use 'Weekday Hours', 'Sunday Hours', 'Holiday Hours', 'Hourly Rate', 'Total Pay?' — all business language. However, method parameters use camelCase implementation terms: 'weekdayHours', 'hourlyRate', 'weekdayPay' instead of matching column names.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
- ❌ **separates-classification-and-calculation**: Payable hours categorisation (1x regular, 1.5x overtime, 2x Sunday/holiday) and pay calculation (hours × rate) are in separate @TableTest methods.
  > The test separates weekday pay, premium pay, and combine logic into different methods. However, the classification (which hours are regular vs overtime) is not shown as a separate table — only the final pay amounts are tested. The 40/41 boundary is shown but the intermediate classification (40 regular + 1 overtime) is not explicitly visible.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-15-reis-discount

**23/25** · 2287509 tokens · 411343ms

- ✅ **2.1-decomposition-concern-separation**: Discount ladder, and traveller eligibility are in separate tables. Rolling window counting as a third table is desirable.
- ✅ **2.2-children-flat-discount**: Children's flat 20% discount is represented — either as a row in the eligibility table or a separate note.
- ✅ **2.3-depth-tier-boundaries**: The discount ladder has multiple tiers derived from the 'every fifth trip' rule, with boundary values or value sets showing which ticket counts produce which discount. The maximum 40% discount is represented.
- ✅ **2.4-depth-rolling-window-boundary**: The 30-day rolling window boundary is tested: a ticket at exactly 30 days is included, at 31 days is excluded.
- ❌ **window-boundary-uses-purchase-time**: The 30-day window is exercised at time-of-purchase granularity, not whole days only. At least one pair of rows must distinguish just-inside from just-outside by less than a day.
  > countSingleTicketsInWindow table uses only whole-day boundaries (30 vs 31 days). The @TypeConverter parses 'daysAgo' as integers and subtracts whole days: 'PURCHASE_TIME.minusDays(daysAgo)'. No sub-day granularity is tested.
- ✅ **2.9-correctness-value-set-tier-semantics**: Value sets in the tier table contain exactly the values that produce the same discount. No cross-tier contamination.
- ✅ **2.15-ticket-count-uses-value-sets**: The discount ladder table uses value sets for the ticket count column to group counts within the same tier — not one row per boundary value.
- ✅ **2.16-no-duplicate-tier-mapping**: The tier-to-discount mapping is expressed once — not repeated across multiple tables.
- ✅ **2.10-format-displayname**: @DisplayName is present on test methods, OR method names read as clear descriptive titles when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **2.11-format-description**: @Description is present on at least the class or the tier method and provides context beyond what the table rows already express.
- ✅ **2.13-format-annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **2.14-format-description-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ❌ **2.17-zone-irrelevance-visible**: The eligibility/passenger-type table includes a Zone column (or equivalent) with a value set to show that the discount applies regardless of zone.
  > discountForCategoryAndTripCount table has no Zone column. countSingleTicketsInWindow tests zone-independence but that is the counting table, not the eligibility table. The eligibility table should explicitly show zone irrelevance.
- ✅ **zone-independent-counting**: The rolling-window counting concern shows by row that a past purchase's zone does not affect whether it counts toward the travel count — for example history entries whose zones differ (or a zone value set) reaching the same count.
- ✅ **2.18-adult-senior-value-set**: Adult and senior are expressed as a value set {ADULT, SENIOR} (or equivalent) in at least one row of the eligibility table.
- ✅ **2.19-depth-all-tiers**: All 9 discount tiers are represented in the ladder table: 0% (tickets 1-4), 5% (5-9), 10% (10-14), 15% (15-19), 20% (20-24), 25% (25-29), 30% (30-34), 35% (35-39), and 40% (40+).
- ✅ **2.20-readability-one-row-per-tier**: Each tier in the discount ladder is expressed as a single row with a value set for ticket counts — not split across multiple rows.
- ✅ **2.21-readability-relative-time**: The rolling window table expresses time relatively (e.g. '14 days ago', '30 days ago', or an integer 'Days ago' column) rather than using absolute dates.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable. Expectation columns vary across rows and are not verbatim copies of input columns.
- ✅ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body. No threshold or operation appears only in method body or field.
- ✅ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on.
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

### ⚠️ Eval eval-18-convert-from-code

**18/24** · 826034 tokens · 148196ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ❌ **black-box-columns**: Table columns represent the method's public inputs (applicant type, age, claim count) and observable outputs (decision, premium) — not internal state like hasActivePolicy, internalRiskScore, or calculateRiskScore.
  > The second @TableTest @Description states: 'Risk score is age/10 + claimCount * 15' and 'score exceeds 75', exposing the internal formula and threshold logic.
- ✅ **observable-io-only**: No column is named after private fields or internal variables (hasActivePolicy, internalRiskScore, riskScore). The test treats the method as a black box.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Applicant type', 'Age', 'Claims', 'Decision?', 'Premium?') — not code identifiers like 'applicantType', 'claimCount', 'String'.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Renewal with no claims', 'Senior applicant') — not outcomes ('Auto approved', 'Rejected').
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: Table has at least one column name ending with '?' (e.g. 'Decision?' or 'Premium?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing unrelated rules.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
- ❌ **separates-decision-and-premium**: Decision logic (AUTO_APPROVED/REJECTED/APPROVED) and premium calculation are in separate @TableTest methods
  > The second @TableTest 'rejectsApplicationsAboveRiskThreshold' includes both Status? and Premium? columns, mixing decision and premium concerns in one table.
- ✅ **no-reimplemented-internals**: Test method body does not recompute internal formulas (e.g. risk score calculation). It only calls the public API (evaluateApplication) and asserts on the return value's fields.
- ❌ **description-no-internals**: @Description explains the test's purpose and business context — not internal formulas or implementation details.
  > The second @Description explicitly states: 'Risk score is age/10 + claimCount * 15. Applications are rejected once the score exceeds 75', exposing internal formula and threshold.
- ❌ **depth-decision-boundaries**: Approval decision table covers the rejection boundary thoroughly: 5 claims triggers rejection regardless of realistic age (risk score crosses 75), 4 claims results in approval. Rows at 4 and 5 claims with varying ages demonstrate this cliff.
  > No dedicated decision table exists. The rejection boundary is tested in 'rejectsApplicationsAboveRiskThreshold' with rows at 5 claims (rejected) but no row at exactly 4 claims to demonstrate the approval boundary. The expected reference table requires rows at both 4 and 5 claims; this test lacks the 4-claim case.
- ❌ **depth-premium-boundaries**: Approved premium table covers boundary effects: the premium jump from 0 to 1 claim (impact of +15 risk score on premium), and the premium difference at age 64 vs 65 (standard vs senior formula). These boundary conditions document how premium changes at each threshold.
  > The premium table `calculatesPremiumByAgeTier` does not isolate the claim-count boundary (0 vs 1 claim). Row 1 has claimCount=1, row 3 has claimCount=0, but they differ in both age (64 vs 30) and claims, so the +15 risk score impact is not isolated. The age-65 boundary is properly isolated (rows 1-2: age 64 vs 65, both claimCount=1).
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable. Judge each @TableTest table independently; the assertion FAILS if any table meets any of these conditions: (1) its expectation column holds the same value in every row; (2) in every row, each expectation cell is a verbatim copy of a cell in an input column of the same row; (3) an implementation that ignored the input columns entirely and returned a fixed value would satisfy every row. Otherwise the assertion PASSES.
- ❌ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body. The assertion FAILS if any of these hold for any @TableTest: (1) a value needed to predict the expectation (a threshold, rate, cutoff, multiplier, reference date) appears only in the method body or a field, and in neither a column, the @DisplayName, nor the @Description; (2) the operation applied to the inputs cannot be named from the column headers and cell values alone; (3) a helper method used in the assertion applies a comparison criterion (ordering, tolerance, subset matching) that is stated nowhere in the table, title, or description. Otherwise the assertion PASSES.
  > The @Description of `rejectsApplicationsAboveRiskThreshold` states 'Risk score is age/10 + claimCount * 15' and 'exceeds 75', exposing internal formulas and thresholds that should not appear in a black-box test description. The spec requires these to be inferred from input/output rows, not stated.
- ✅ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName (or the method name it falls back to) states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on. Apply the check mechanically: strike the system under test from the sentence — if it still reads as true, because it merely restates a regulation, standard, format, or domain fact, the title is about something else and fails.

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ❌ **list-syntax-correct**: List values in the table use bracket syntax like [tech:java, biz:sales, dev:ci] — not comma-separated strings without brackets.
  > ["tech:java", "dev:python", "biz:sales", "ops:deploy"] uses quoted strings inside brackets, but unquoted colons like tech:java without quotes would parse as maps. The response uses quotes correctly, but the assertion tests whether the notation itself (not just correctness) is demonstrated.
- ✅ **empty-list-explicit**: Empty list input uses [] (not a blank cell, which represents null). The distinction between empty list and null is preserved.
- ✅ **special-chars-quoted**: Values containing pipes (|), brackets, or colons (:) are properly quoted (e.g. "tech:java") so they don't conflict with table syntax.
- ✅ **set-syntax-correct**: Set<String> values in the table use curly brace syntax like {tech, dev} — not bracket syntax [tech, dev] which is for lists.
- ✅ **newline-in-cell**: A cell value containing a newline does not break the table row structure: the newline is either escaped as \n inside the cell, or the value is expressed as a list of lines joined in the test body.
- ✅ **pipe-quoted**: Values containing pipe characters (|) are quoted so they don't conflict with the markdown table column separator.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Filtered tags?' or 'Result?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **no-blank-collection-elements**: No collection value in any table contains a blank element. `[a, , c]`, `[a, b, ]` and `[, a, b]` are parse errors, not collections holding a null element.
- ✅ **empty-string-element-quoted**: An empty tag inside a tag list is written as a quoted empty string ("" or ''), not as a blank element.

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **validation-rules-covered**: Email validation and name-required error scenarios are present — at least one row for invalid email and one for missing name.
- ✅ **blank-for-absent-optional**: Dietary requirements and/or accessibility needs use blank cells (null) when not provided — not 'N/A' or 'none'.
- ✅ **blank-vs-value-set-correct**: When testing pricing rules, irrelevant inputs use value sets or representative values — not blanks.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Result?', 'Price?')
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Name', 'Email', 'Registration date', 'Group size', 'Price?') — not code identifiers.
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Early-bird single attendee', 'Missing name') — not outcomes ('Rejected', '20% off').
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements

- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple tables (or @TableTest methods) are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations.
- ✅ **separates-validation-and-pricing**: Input validation and pricing/discount calculation are in separate @TableTest methods
- ✅ **validation-includes-optional-fields**: Validation @TableTest includes Dietary Requirements and Accessibility Needs columns, with rows showing both null and non-null values are accepted.
- ✅ **descriptive-registration-date**: Registration date uses descriptive values (e.g. 'before cutoff', 'on cutoff', 'after cutoff') with a @TypeConverter method converting to actual dates.
- ✅ **cutoff-date-column-if-literal-dates**: If registration dates are literal (e.g. '2025-02-28' instead of descriptive), the early-bird cutoff date appears as a separate policy column so the reader can see both dates and verify the comparison. Passes automatically if descriptive date values are used.
- ❌ **description-no-irrelevant-information**: If @Description is present, it does not include information that is already visible in the table columns or that can be derived from the table structure — such as fixed input values that could be columns, or restating the discount rules that the rows already demonstrate.
  > Pricing @Description states 'groups of 5 or more get 15% off' and 'early-bird registrations (before 2025-03-01) get 20% off' — rules already demonstrated by the table rows themselves.
- ✅ **discount-column-preferred**: Output column is 'Discount?' (percentage or amount off) rather than 'Price?' — making verification simpler (discount is the rule's direct output; price requires knowing the base price). If 'Price?' is used instead, both 'Base price' and 'Price?' columns must be present so the reader can trace the calculation.
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **optional-fields-has-expected-column**: The optional-fields acceptance table includes an expectation/output column (e.g. 'Approved?', 'Result?', or 'Status?') asserting that each combination is accepted — not just varying inputs without any expected column.
- ✅ **description-no-redundant-field-values**: Scenario names and @Description text do not restate values the table already shows. The assertion FAILS if either: (1) a scenario name contains a literal value that also appears in an input cell of the same row (e.g. scenario 'Age 35, score 700' beside Age and Credit score columns holding 35 and 700); or (2) @Description states a fixed value for an input that is already a column in that table. Otherwise it PASSES.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency

Otherwise the assertion PASSES.
  > Pricing table uses value set '{5, 20}' for group size without explaining in @Description or table that both 5 and 20 should yield the same 15% discount. The rule 'groups of 5 or more' is stated in @Description but the table does not show why 20 is grouped with 5.

**20/21** · 540843 tokens · 149866ms

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **threshold-verifiable-from-table**: Each policy threshold (650 for non-seniors, 600 for seniors) is verifiable from the table, in one of two ways: (a) a dedicated policy column (e.g. 'Credit threshold') beside the applicant's score, or (b) boundary rows that bracket it — within one age band, a row that qualifies just above the threshold and a row that fails at/below it, carrying different decisions.
- ✅ **concrete-domain-values**: Cell values use concrete domain terms (e.g. '70', '650', 'APPROVED') — not abstract codes like 'CATEGORY_A' or '1'. Boolean true/false is acceptable for yes/no flags when the parameter type is boolean.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Senior at lower threshold', 'Missing income') — not outcomes ('Approved', 'Rejected').
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Age', 'Credit score', 'Stable income', 'Decision?') — not code identifiers like 'customerAge', 'boolean'.
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Decision?' or 'Status?')
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: The distinct concerns (age→threshold, credit boundary, income status) are each covered, without a monolithic table that re-proves unrelated rules through redundant permutations. A single table is acceptable when the concerns share the same input columns and each is covered by only a row or two.
- ✅ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each table has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns. Fewer rows per table is expected when concerns are properly separated.
- ✅ **covers-age-credit-income**: Age boundary policy, credit score categorisation, and income status are each covered by minimal scenarios. This may be one @TableTest whose rows exercise each concern (boundary pairs for age/credit, income held-constant rows for income status) or separate methods per concern with a combining verdict — both are correct given only a row or two per concern.
- ✅ **description-no-redundant-field-values**: Scenario names and @Description text do not restate values the table already shows. The assertion FAILS if either: (1) a scenario name contains a literal value that also appears in an input cell of the same row (e.g. scenario 'Age 35, score 700' beside Age and Credit score columns holding 35 and 700); or (2) @Description states a fixed value for an input that is already a column in that table.
- ✅ **depth-stable-income-effect**: The effect of stable income on the outcome is visible from table rows, not merely implied. The assertion PASSES if some single @TableTest table contains two rows that differ in the stable-income column (or equivalent) while holding the credit score and age columns equal, and those two rows carry different expected decisions.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable.

- ✅ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body.
- ❌ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on.
  > @Description states 'Standard applicants are approved above a credit score of 650; senior applicants (age 65+) are approved above a lower threshold of 600.' Striking 'the code under test' leaves 'applicants are approved above 650/600' — a domain rule, not what the evaluator does. The description restates policy rather than describing the evaluator's behaviour.

- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Message?', 'Total?', 'Active coupon after?')
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe conditions ('Add to empty cart', 'Replace active coupon with expired') — not outcomes ('Error', 'Success').
- ❌ **business-language-columns**: Column names use domain/business language (e.g. 'Product', 'Quantity', 'Message?', 'Cart total?') — not code identifiers like 'productId', 'result'.
  > Column header 'Product Id' appears in addsItemsFromTheCatalogue and removesItemsFromTheCart; should be 'Product' per reference
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **single-assertion-in-method**: Each @TableTest method applies one uniform assertion pattern to every row — not different assertions per scenario. Several unconditional assertions checking distinct observable outputs of one result (e.g. success, message, resulting cart) count as one uniform pattern; the anti-pattern is branching on the row (if/switch/ternary/try-catch) to choose what is asserted.
- ✅ **test-data-visible**: Product prices and coupon rules (type, amount, expiry status) are visible in the table via columns, @Description, or explicit setup — not silently hardcoded. The reader can trace how inputs lead to outputs.
- ✅ **type-converters-for-complex-objects**: TypeConverter methods are used to convert map/string table values into domain objects (e.g. Map → Cart, Map → InventoryService, map → Coupon). Test method bodies contain only arrange-act-assert — no object construction from raw table values.
- ❌ **coupon-as-single-column**: Coupon data is expressed in a single column with a @TypeConverter — not spread across separate sparse columns for coupon type, value, and target product.
  > The 'Coupon In Store' column uses raw enum form (e.g., 'PERCENT 10', 'FIXED 5.00', 'PRODUCT Widget 3.00', 'EXPIRED') parsed by a custom @TypeConverter, but the 'Active Coupon' columns in applyCouponsToTheCart use coupon *codes* (e.g., 'SAVE10', 'FIVEOFF'), not coupon definitions. The test conflates coupon codes with coupon objects.
- ✅ **uses-standard-map-syntax**: Columns representing maps use standard TableTest map syntax — [k: v, k2: v2] for entries and [:] for empty map — not a custom bracket notation.
- ✅ **description-not-redundant-with-scenarios**: @Description annotations do not repeat information that the scenario names already convey.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
- ✅ **rule-falsifiable-by-a-row**: Cell values make the rule falsifiable, not merely distinguishable.
- ✅ **rule-statable-from-table**: A reader can state the rule from the table alone, without the test method body.
- ✅ **title-states-system-behaviour**: Each @DisplayName states what the code under test does, not an external fact it depends on.
- ✅ **compiles**: The generated test code compiles successfully against the project scaffolding

- ✅ **has-tabletest-annotation**: Output contains a @TableTest annotation
- ✅ **concerns-decomposed**: Multiple @TableTest methods are used, each addressing a distinct concern — not one monolithic table mixing all splitting rules.
- ❌ **minimal-rows-per-concern**: Each @TableTest has only the rows needed to express its concern's rules — no unnecessary permutations from combining concerns.
  > First table has 6 rows (including interaction case 'Delivery split by address, plus a separate pickup item'); spec lists 4 obligations, one optional interaction. Second table has 6 rows where 3 obligations exist (in-stock not held for backordered AND separately for pre-ordered is redundant under two-state model).
- ✅ **concern-fulfillment-method**: Fulfillment method splitting is represented as its own @TableTest — items with different fulfillment types (store pickup vs home delivery) cannot share a shipment.
- ✅ **concern-delivery-address**: Delivery address splitting is represented as its own @TableTest — items going to different addresses must be in separate shipments.
- ✅ **concern-availability**: Availability splitting is represented as its own @TableTest — in-stock items ship immediately, backordered/pre-ordered items ship when available.
- ✅ **concern-warehouse-allocation**: Warehouse allocation (minimising shipments) is represented as its own @TableTest — choosing which warehouses to ship from to minimise total shipment count.
- ✅ **concern-companion-products**: Companion product grouping is represented as its own @TableTest — paired items (e.g. camera body and lens) should ship together from the same location when possible.
- ✅ **all-outputs-same-table**: Each @TableTest method includes all output columns for its concern in the same table — e.g. warehouse allocation includes both the assignment and shipment count, not split across methods.
- ✅ **scenario-column-present**: Table has a scenario/description column as the leftmost column
- ✅ **has-question-mark-column**: At least one output column name ends with '?' (e.g. 'Shipments?', 'Groups?')
- ✅ **scenario-names-describe-conditions**: Scenario names describe the business situation (e.g. 'Consolidate: two beats three', 'Everything at one warehouse') — not 'Test case 2'.
- ✅ **business-language-columns**: Column names use business/domain language (e.g. 'Shipments?' not 'Result?', 'Warehouse stock' not 'inventory_map'). The tables read as a specification a product person could review.
- ✅ **no-if-switch-in-method**: Test method body contains no if or switch statements
- ✅ **annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **has-descriptive-title**: Test method has either a @DisplayName annotation or a method name that reads as a clear, descriptive title when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **description-uses-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **has-tabletest-dependency**: The build file (build.gradle) includes org.tabletest:tabletest-junit as a test dependency
