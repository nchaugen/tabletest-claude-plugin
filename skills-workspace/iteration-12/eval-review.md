## Per-Eval Results

### ⚠️ Eval eval-14-weekly-pay [with_skill]

**14/15** · 303464 tokens · 339564ms

- ✅ **1.1-traceability-columns**: The pay table includes intermediate expected columns (e.g. Regular pay?, Overtime pay?, Premium pay?) so the reader can trace which rule contributes what — not just a single total Weekly pay? column.
- ✅ **1.2-error-has-expected-column**: The error/rejection table has an expected column (e.g. 'Throws?' or 'Exception?') specifying the exception type per row — rather than hardcoding the exception type in @Description or the method name.
- ✅ **1.3-depth-overtime-boundary**: Overtime threshold boundary is covered: at least a value at the threshold (40) and just above (41 or similar). Not just values well below and well above.
- ✅ **1.4-depth-combined-scenario**: A combined scenario is present: a row with weekday + Sunday + holiday hours, testing the composition of all hour types.
- ✅ **1.5-depth-error-edge-cases**: Error/edge cases covered: at least negative hours (floored at zero) and negative or missing rate (rejected).
- ✅ **1.6-readability-empty-cells**: Sunday and Holiday hour columns use empty cells (not 0) when those inputs are not relevant to a scenario — making it easier to spot which rows involve weekend/holiday hours. This is a readability preference; parameter types should be Integer (not int) to support null from blank cells.
- ✅ **1.7-readability-scenario-names**: Scenario names describe work patterns (e.g. 'Part-time', 'Five hours overtime', 'Full Sunday shift') — not 'Test case 1' or expected outcomes.
- ✅ **1.8-correctness-expected-values**: Expected values in intermediate and total columns are arithmetically correct for every row, consistent with the formulas in @Description.
- ✅ **1.9-correctness-value-set-semantics**: Value sets are only used where all values in the set produce the same expected result (e.g. any rate × 0 = 0). Not used where results would differ.
- ✅ **1.10-format-displayname**: @DisplayName is present on test methods, OR method names read as clear descriptive titles when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **1.11-format-description**: @Description is present on at least the pay calculation method and provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as the overtime threshold (40 hours), premium multipliers (Sunday 2×, Holiday 2.5×), or other fixed assumptions not visible in the table. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show.
- ✅ **1.12-format-annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **1.13-format-description-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ❌ **1.14-depth-zero-rate**: A row where the hourly rate is zero, showing that pay is zero regardless of hours worked. This is a distinct edge case from negative rate (which is rejected).
  > The table contains 'Zero hours, any rate' with hours 0 and rate {10.00, 20.00}, but no row with rate 0.00 and nonzero hours (e.g. '40 | | | 0.00 | 0.00 | | | 0.00'). Negative rates are covered but zero rate is not.
- ✅ **1.15-format-clean-method**: The test method body contains no if/ternary null-handling or parsing logic. Null-to-default conversion (e.g. blank Sunday hours → 0) is handled via a @TypeConverter method or a private helper, keeping the test method limited to arrange/act/assert.

**16/18** · 276981 tokens · 253045ms

- ✅ **2.1-decomposition-concern-separation**: Discount ladder, and traveller eligibility are in separate tables. Rolling window counting as a third table is desirable.
- ✅ **2.2-children-flat-discount**: Children's flat 20% discount is represented — either as a row in the eligibility table or a separate note. It does not follow the ladder.
- ✅ **2.3-depth-tier-boundaries**: The discount ladder has multiple tiers derived from the 'every fifth trip' rule, with boundary values or value sets showing which ticket counts produce which discount. The maximum 40% discount is represented.
- ✅ **2.4-depth-rolling-window-boundary**: The 30-day rolling window boundary is tested: a ticket at exactly 30 days is included, at 31 days is excluded.
- ✅ **2.6-readability-human-readable-values**: Eligibility uses human-readable values (yes/no or equivalent) rather than raw true/false. TypeConverter or similar mechanism mentioned.
- ✅ **2.9-correctness-value-set-tier-semantics**: Value sets in the tier table contain exactly the values that produce the same discount. No cross-tier contamination.
- ✅ **2.10-format-displayname**: @DisplayName is present on test methods, OR method names read as clear descriptive titles when converted from camelCase/snake_case.
- ✅ **2.11-format-description**: @Description is present on at least the class or the tier method and provides context beyond what the table rows already express — such as the discount ladder structure, eligibility rules, or application context. Does NOT merely restate the column names or summarise what the rows show.
- ✅ **2.12-format-typeconverter**: TypeConverterSources is used for at least one human-readable conversion (yes/no, or rolling window notation).
- ✅ **2.13-format-annotation-order**: Annotations appear in order: @DisplayName (if present), @Description (if present), @TableTest — not any other order.
- ✅ **2.14-format-description-textblock**: If @Description is present and the text is longer than a single short line, it uses a text block (triple-quoted string """), not string concatenation with +. Passes if @Description is absent.
- ✅ **2.15-ticket-count-uses-value-sets**: The discount ladder table uses value sets for the ticket count column to group counts within the same tier (e.g. {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} or {5, 9} for min/max → 5%) — not one row per boundary value. The 'every fifth trip' rule creates tiers; the table should express tiers, not enumerate boundaries.
- ✅ **2.16-no-duplicate-tier-mapping**: The tier-to-discount mapping is expressed once — not repeated across multiple tables. A price application table (if present) should test the arithmetic (base price × discount → final price) without re-enumerating which ticket counts map to which tier.
- ❌ **2.17-zone-irrelevance-visible**: The eligibility/passenger-type table includes a Zone column (or equivalent) with a value set to show that the discount applies regardless of zone — rather than silently omitting zone. The requirement explicitly says 'regardless of the zones you travel in'.
  > discountByPassengerType table has columns: Scenario, Passenger type, Tickets in last 30 days, Discount?—no Zone column is present to demonstrate zone irrelevance.
- ❌ **2.18-adult-senior-value-set**: Adult and senior are expressed as a value set {ADULT, SENIOR} (or equivalent) in at least one row of the eligibility table, since they follow identical discount rules. Not enumerated as separate rows with the same outcome.
  > discountByPassengerType lists ADULT and SENIOR as separate rows: 'Adult, below threshold | ADULT | 3 | 0', 'Senior, below threshold | SENIOR | 3 | 0', etc.—enumerated separately rather than combined as a value set {ADULT, SENIOR}.
- ✅ **2.19-depth-all-tiers**: All 9 discount tiers are represented in the ladder table: 0% (tickets 1-4), 5% (5-9), 10% (10-14), 15% (15-19), 20% (20-24), 25% (25-29), 30% (30-34), 35% (35-39), and 40% (40+). Not just a subset of tiers.
- ✅ **2.20-readability-one-row-per-tier**: Each tier in the discount ladder is expressed as a single row with a value set for ticket counts — not split across multiple rows (e.g. separate rows for 'tier kicks in' and 'tier holds'). One tier = one row.
- ✅ **2.21-readability-relative-time**: The rolling window table expresses time relatively (e.g. '14 days ago', '30 days ago', or an integer 'Days ago' column) rather than using absolute dates, making the table readable without needing to know the reference date.

### ⚠️ Eval eval-16-order-splitting [with_skill]

**16/17** · 77674 tokens · 210856ms

- ✅ **3.1a-concern-fulfillment-method**: Fulfillment method splitting is represented as its own table — items with different fulfillment types (store pickup vs home delivery) cannot share a shipment.
- ✅ **3.1b-concern-delivery-address**: Delivery address splitting is represented as its own table — items going to different addresses must be in separate shipments.
- ✅ **3.1c-concern-availability**: Availability splitting is represented as its own table — in-stock items ship immediately, backordered/pre-ordered items ship when available.
- ✅ **3.1d-concern-warehouse-allocation**: Warehouse allocation (minimising shipments) is represented as its own table — choosing which warehouses to ship from to minimise total shipment count.
- ✅ **3.1e-concern-companion-products**: Companion product grouping is represented as its own table — paired items (e.g. camera body and lens) should ship together from the same location when possible.
- ✅ **3.2-depth-fulfillment-scenarios**: Fulfillment table covers at least: all items for home delivery, all items for store pickup, and a mix of delivery and pickup items.
- ✅ **3.3-depth-delivery-address-scenarios**: Delivery address table covers at least: all items to the same address, and items to different addresses.
- ✅ **3.4-depth-availability-scenarios**: Availability table covers at least: all items in stock, a mix of in-stock and pre-order/backorder, and two backordered/pre-ordered items with different dates. Pre-order and backorder are recognised as equivalent for splitting semantics — either by comment, note, or by including both with the same rules.
- ✅ **3.5-depth-warehouse-scenarios**: Warehouse allocation table covers at least: single warehouse has full quantity, multi-warehouse split needed, fewer-warehouse split preferred over more warehouses, and cannot fulfill (insufficient total stock).
- ❌ **3.6-depth-companion-scenarios**: Companion table covers at least: single warehouse has both companions, unavoidable split (no warehouse has both but both are available), and fulfillment not possible (one companion not available anywhere).
  > Table 5 includes: 'Single warehouse stocks both companions' (first scenario) and 'No warehouse stocks both companions' (fourth scenario with unavoidable split: Chicago: body, LA: lens). However, no scenario shows fulfillment impossible due to one companion being completely unavailable at any warehouse—all companion scenarios involve both items being available somewhere.
- ✅ **3.7-readability-scenario-names**: Scenario names describe the business situation (e.g. 'Consolidate: two beats three', 'Everything at one warehouse') — not 'Test case 2'.
- ✅ **3.8-readability-item-property-mapping**: Trigger tables represent multi-item orders where each item has its own fulfillment type, address, and availability. The notation makes the item-to-property mapping unambiguous — not value sets like {delivery, pickup} which lose which item has which property.
- ✅ **3.9-readability-scalar-column**: Warehouse allocation table uses a scalar count column (e.g. 'Qty ordered') not item lists, when product identity doesn't matter for the logic.
- ✅ **3.10-readability-business-language**: Column names use business/domain language (e.g. 'Shipments?' not 'Result?', 'Warehouse stock' not 'inventory_map'). The tables read as a specification a product person could review.
- ✅ **3.11-readability-output-column-question-mark**: Output/expected columns end with '?' (e.g. 'Shipments?', 'Groups?') to distinguish them from input columns.
- ✅ **3.12-correctness-valid-assignments**: Inventory assignments are physically valid: items are only assigned to locations that have them. Shipment counts match the assignments shown.
- ✅ **3.13-depth-open-questions**: Multiple open questions are surfaced across the tables — ambiguities, edge cases, or product decisions that the requirements don't fully specify.

### ✅ Eval eval-17-shopping-cart [with_skill]

**16/16** · 68687 tokens · 71618ms

- ✅ **4.1a-concern-item-operations**: Item operations (add/remove) are represented as their own table or tables — separate from coupon and cart total logic.
- ✅ **4.1b-concern-coupon-application**: Coupon application (entering, replacing, rejecting codes) is represented as its own table — separate from item operations and cart total calculation.
- ✅ **4.1c-concern-cart-total**: Cart total calculation (how different coupon types affect the price) is represented as its own table — separate from coupon application and item operations.
- ✅ **4.1d-concern-checkout**: Checkout (stock verification) is represented as its own table — separate from the other concerns.
- ✅ **4.3-rows-independently-executable**: Each table row is independently executable — no row depends on a prior row's result. The table expresses rules, not a sequential test script.
- ✅ **4.4-depth-item-operations**: Item operations cover at least: add to empty cart, add to non-empty cart, add more of an item already in cart, remove item from cart, remove last item in cart, remove item not in cart.
- ✅ **4.5-depth-coupon-application**: Coupon application table covers validity and replacement — not coupon types. Scenarios include at least: add valid coupon (none active), add valid coupon (another active), add expired coupon (none active), add expired coupon (another active), add nonexistent code (none active), add nonexistent code (another active).
- ✅ **4.6-depth-cart-total-scenarios**: Cart total table covers how different coupon types affect the price. Scenarios include at least: no coupon, percentage off whole cart, fixed amount off, fixed amount exceeding cart total (floors at zero), product-specific discount (product in cart), product-specific discount (product not in cart).
- ✅ **4.7-depth-checkout-scenarios**: Checkout table covers at least: empty cart, all items in stock, and not all items in stock (insufficient inventory).
- ✅ **4.8-readability-business-language**: Column names use business/user-perspective language (e.g. 'Message?' not 'Result?', 'Coupon code' not 'input'). The tables read as a specification a product person could review.
- ✅ **4.9-readability-test-data-visible**: Test data that affects the outcome — product prices, coupon rules (type, amount, expiry) — is visible in the table via columns, notes, or explicit setup, not silently hardcoded. The reader can trace how inputs lead to outputs.
- ✅ **4.10-depth-open-questions**: Multiple open questions are surfaced — ambiguities or product decisions the requirements don't specify (e.g. what happens to a product-specific coupon when that product is removed, or how percentage and product-specific discounts interact).
- ✅ **4.11-correctness-cart-totals**: Cart totals are arithmetically correct: sum(quantity × price) − coupon = total, for every row in the total calculation table.
- ✅ **4.12-coupon-expiry-column**: Coupon application table uses a column to signal expiry status — either an 'Expired?' yes/no column, a 'Status' column, or equivalent. Expiry is visible per row, not just implied by the scenario name.
- ✅ **4.14-coupon-before-after-columns**: Coupon application table uses before/after columns (e.g. 'Active coupon' / 'Active coupon after?') to specify the state change when entering, replacing, or entering invalid coupon codes.
- ✅ **4.15-readability-scenario-names**: Scenario names describe the business situation (e.g. 'Add more of same product', 'Replace active coupon') — not 'Test case 1' or generic labels.
