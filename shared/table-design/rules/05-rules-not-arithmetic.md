### Separate Rules from Arithmetic

Tables specify the interesting decisions — classifications, eligibility rules, tier lookups, state
transitions — not that multiplication works.

**The symptom is an expectation cell you cannot predict in one step.** If reading a {{row}} means
classifying first and then computing, the table has fused two rules and states neither.

Give the classification its own table, whose expectation columns *are* the classification. Give the
arithmetic its own, taking the classification as an input. Each table then states one rule, and every
cell is predictable from its {{row}}.

This usually needs a narrower function to call. A table that can only reach the fused result means
the seam is missing, not that the table must fuse.
